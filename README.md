# Monte Carlo Simulation of Portfolio Returns

This project models future portfolio values using a Monte Carlo simulation based on **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**. Historical market data is used to estimate drift and volatility, simulate thousands of price paths, and analyze the distribution of possible outcomes and downside risk.

**Key features**

* GBM-based price modeling
* Drift and volatility estimated from log returns
* Vectorized Monte Carlo simulation
* Distribution analysis and Value-at-Risk (VaR)

**Tools**
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, yfinance
